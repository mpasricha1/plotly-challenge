<h1>Plotly Challenge</h1>

<h3>Purpose</h3> 
<p>The purpose of this project was to build a dashboard with several plots on the Belly Button Biodiversity dataset. 
   Data was provided through a JSON file. The file was read in and then the plots were build. The three plots that were 
   create were as followed</p> 
<ul>
<li>Bar Chart for OTU's For Sample</li>
<li>A Gauge for Belly Button Washing Frequency</li>
<liBubble Chart of each sample</li>
</ul> 

<p>The main script is a javascript file that creates all the plots. Each plot is created by its own function.
   This allows for each plot to be build independently if needed in the future. A drop down menu is provided to 
   switch between all the samples in the data set.</p>
